            <p>I am a third year student at Cornell University studying Computer Science. My goal is to leverage my
                knowledge and experience to advocate for social justice in all areas. I am based in the San Francisco
                Bay Area.

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>Team ANDD Database Management System</h3>
            
            <p>The Team ANDD Database Management System, implemented entirely in Java, handles SQL query execution on a given tableset. The system supports both unindexed and single-indexed tables, and features multiple optimizations to minimize execution time.
                I completed this project with a group of three other classmates for my <a href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA24/class/CS/4321">Practicum in Database Systems</a> class. Along with writing the code in collaboration, I also was responsible for designing the project architecture, delegating necessary tasks amongst the group, and managing version control. </p>

            <h3>RISC-V Interpreter</h3>
            
            <p>The RISC-V Interpreter takes in and evaluates programs written in the RISC-V assembly language. It supports a subset of RISC-V instructions for arithmetic, memory operations, and branch operations. The interpreter simulates memory and RAM using linked lists or hash tables. I developed this
                interpreter as part of my <a href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP24/class/CS/3410">Computer Organization and Systems Programming</a> class. My contribution was implementing the memory simulation and program evaluation. I wrote the interpreter entirely in the C programming language.</p>
            <h3>Big Red Blockchain</h3>
            
            <p>Big Red Blockchain is a proof-of-concept blockchain application written entirely in the OCaml programming language. Users can
                mine blocks, create wallets and make transactions, and observe the ledger. I worked with a team of 3 of my classmates to develop Big Red
                Blockchain for our <a href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA23/class/CS/3110">Data Structures and Functional Programming</a> class. My main contributions were implementing wallet functionality and designing test suites.</p>
