            <p>(He/Him/His) I am a third year student at Cornell University studying Computer Science. My goal is to leverage my
                knowledge and experience to advocate for social justice in all areas. I am based in the San Francisco
                Bay Area.

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>RISC-V Interpreter</h3>
            
            <p>The RISC-V Interpreter takes in and evaluates programs written in the RISC-V assembly language. It supports a subset of RISC-V instructions for arithmetic, memory operations, and branch operations. The interpreter simulates memory and RAM using linked lists or hash tables. I developed this
                interpreter as part of my Computer Organization and Systems Programming class. My contribution was implementing the memory simulation and program evaluation. I wrote the interpreter entirely in the C programming language.</p>
            <h3>Big Red Blockchain</h3>
            
            <p>Big Red Blockchain is a proof-of-concept blockchain application written entirely in the OCaml programming language. Users can
                mine blocks, create wallets and make transactions, and observe the ledger. I worked with a team of 3 of my classmates to develop Big Red
                Blockchain for our Data Structures and Functional Programming class. My main contributions were implementing wallet functionality and designing test suites.</p>
