    <p>I am a fourth year student at Cornell University studying Computer Science. My interest is in using
        data and artificial intelligence to efficiently solve problems.
    </p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Beetle Chess Engine</h3>
    <p>
        Beetle is a chess engine that uses artificial intelligence to plays against opponents.
        To select optimal moves, and performs a static and dynamic evaluation of 
        various possible game states. Beetle also employs minimax and alpha-beta
        pruning to efficiently return the best possible moves. Beetle was 
        developed in Python using the chess.py library.

    <h3><a href=https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/dtt35/dbprac>Team ANDD Database Management System</a></h3>

    <p>The Team ANDD Database Management System, implemented entirely in Java, handles SQL query execution on a given
        tableset. The system supports both unindexed and single-indexed tables, and features multiple optimizations to
        minimize execution time. I completed this project with a group of three other classmates for my <a
            href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA24/class/CS/4321">Practicum in Database Systems</a> class.
        Along with writing the code in collaboration, I also was responsible for designing the project architecture,
        delegating necessary tasks amongst the group, and managing version control.
        We used JSqlParser to handle SQL queries and JUnit for integration testing.
         </p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/dtt35/cs4414-hw3">Retrieval-Augmented Generation Pipeline</a></h3>

    <p>
        The Retrieval-Augmented Generation Pipeline enhances the quality of LLM outputs by enabling the model to reference
        given documents. The pipeline uses a FAISS vector index and L2 similarity search to identify relevant context and
        the <i>bge-base-en-v1.5</i> enmbedding model to generate vector embeddings. These embeddings are then added to the
        vector index, so that when a text prompt is inputted, the pipeline can reference relevant context and augment
        the prompt to include these text strings. I completed this as a final project for my 
        <a href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA25/class/CS/4414">Systems Programming</a> class. I developed
        the pipeline entirely in Python, using the faiss and llama-cpp-python libraries.

    <h3>Big Red Blockchain</h3>

    <p>Big Red Blockchain is a proof-of-concept blockchain application written entirely in the OCaml programming
        language. Users can mine blocks, create wallets and make transactions, and observe the ledger. I worked with a team of 3 of my
        classmates to develop Big Red
        Blockchain for our <a href="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA23/class/CS/3110">Data Structures and
            Functional Programming</a> class. My main contributions were implementing wallet functionality and designing
        test suites. We used Dune for the build system and OUnit for testing.</p>
    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p><b>Programming Languages: </b>Java, Python, C++, OCaml, SQL</p>
    <p><b>Libraries/Frameworks: </b>PyTorch, NumPy, llama-cpp, JUnit, ALGLIB</p>
    <p><b>Software: </b> Git, Jupyter, FL Studio</p>
